## The Benefits of the MERN Stack

The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that‚Äôs used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there‚Äôs no need for context switching.
For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.
Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
