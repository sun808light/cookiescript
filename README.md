CookieScript Boilerplate uses familiar tools and implements best practices around them to provide you a SOLID development experience.
This project does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>CookieScript offers a built-in tool for the command line is known as Geek which allows performing the majority of those tedious and repetitive programming tasks that many JavaScript developers avoid performing manually.</dd>

 <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
 <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Intact Security</dt>
  <dd>Application security is one of the most important factors in web application development. While developing an application, a programmer needs to take effective ways to secure the application.</dd>

  <dt>Authentication</dt>
  <dd>Authentication is the most important factor in a web application, and developers need to spend a lot of time writing the authentication code. CookieScript contains an inbuilt authentication system, you only need to configure models, views, and controllers to make the application work.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>

  <dt>Mail Integration</dt>
  <dd>CookieScript uses free feature-rich library NodeMailer to send emails. Using the library function, we can easily send emails without too many hassles. The e-mail templates are loaded in the same way as views, which means you can use the Blade syntax and inject data into your templates.</dd>

  <dt>Database Caching</dt>
  <dd>CookieScript uses redis caching service in order to create high performance services</dd>
