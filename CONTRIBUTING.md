## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Rails**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://rubyonrails.org/security/).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Ruby on Rails](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).
